'''#bag of visual words technique: clustering descriptors and finding cluster centers to create
compact representation of the dataset to reduce the complexity'''

'''aggregates local image descriptors (such as SIFT) into a single 
fixed-length vector representation, which can then be used for tasks like image 
classification or retrieval'''


local descriptors lack global context so it needs to encode them into global descriptors by using vlad


global desc provides compact and comprehensive representation of the image


Vlad Steps:
1. clustering: local descriptors are clustered using k-means to obtain cluster centers (visual words)
2. assignment: each local descriptor is assigned to the nearest cluster centers
3. residual calculation: compute the difference (residuals) bw each descriptors and its assigned cluster centre
4. aggregation: aggregate the residuals for each clusters (sum pooling or gmp)
5. apply power norm and l2 norm to enhance the robustness




"""
exepmlar classification: where a class is represented by one or more specific examples from training data
It relies on examples from the training set.
each class is represented by a single exemplar (example)
we need SVM to do examplar classification.
